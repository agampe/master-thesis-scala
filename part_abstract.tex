\section*{Abstract}   
This October sees the release of our first Time of Legends audio drama: Aenarion. Aenarion's story is one of the cornerstones of high elf history, so we've placed it in the capable hands of Black Library stalwart, Gav Thorpe. As with the ToL novel covers we've managed to rope in Jon 'sleep is for wimps' Sullivan. We reminded him that CD covers are actually quite small, but it didn't stop him layering an insane amount of detail onto Aenarion's armour. It seems a crime that we're going to have to show it so small on the cover, so here's the whole piece in all its unadulterated glory.

Was soll ich blo√ü noch schreiben. Ich habe echt keine Ahnung was ich dir noch alles so sagen soll.

Nun kann ich eventuell noch einen weiteren Satz schreiben.
